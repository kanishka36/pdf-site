        With the onset of the pandemic, and the subsequent economic turbulence
        that is being felt across the world, each passing year has presented us
        with unprecedented challenges to deal with as a business. The year 2022
        was no different, with a particularly challenging climate in Sri Lanka
        due to the economic crisis that hit in the early months, followed by the
        impact of the global economic headwinds felt during the latter part of
        the year.

      <h2>
        As a company built on the strength of its people, during challenging
        times like these our focus remains on our employees across the globe,
        supporting them through turbulent times, while positioning the overall
        business for longevity and securing sustainable, equitable growth for
        the future.
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the year 2022, MAS focused on strengthening the core of our business,
        by building a diversified and resilient customer portfolio, improving
        efficiencies in manufacturing, and securing an optimized supply chain.
        With the addition of new customers from new geographies to our
        portfolio, the strategic engagement through the joint venture with Tata
        Group’s Trent Ltd, and the launch of TEXO through the acquisition of BAM
        Knitting in Sri Lanka, we have provided our business with key building
        blocks for the future, while augmenting a vertically integrated
        manufacturing footprint in Sri Lanka.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, we also witnessed the growth of our femtech vertical, recently
        rebranded as femography, and strengthened through new customer
        partnerships. Our Adaptive Centre of Excellence, Lable by MAS, was
        formally launched in 2022, building on years of work in this space to
        further develop our capability in offering adaptive apparel solutions
        for persons with disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a key focus on creating sustainable alternatives for the products
        and apparel solutions that we offer our customers, our strategic
        business unit Noyon Lanka introduced ‘Planetones,’ a 100% natural dye
        solution certified by the Control Union, through which we continue to
        explore the opportunity of creating garments coloured exclusively with
        natural dyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our biggest strength remains the collective capability of MAS,
        innovating new technologies that are applicable across multiple product
        categories, enabling us to offer integrated innovation, design,
        development, manufacturing and supply chain solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A testament to these efforts is the recent recognition of our innovation
        arm, Twinery, by Fast Company in its list for ‘Best Workplaces for
        Innovators’. This recognition honours organisations committed to
        innovation at all levels, and it was a privilege to see MAS being ranked
        among other global giants such as Microsoft and Siemens.
