            With the onset of the pandemic, and the subsequent economic
            turbulence that is being felt across the world, each passing year
            has presented us with unprecedented challenges to deal with as a
            business. The year 2022 was no different, with a particularly
            challenging climate in Sri Lanka due to the economic crisis that hit
            in the early months, followed by the impact of the global economic
            headwinds felt during the latter part of the year.
          </p>
          <h2>
            As a company built on the strength of its people, during challenging
            times like these our focus remains on our employees across the
            globe, supporting them through turbulent times, while positioning
            the overall business for longevity and securing sustainable,
            equitable growth for the future.
          </h2>
          <p>
            In the year 2022, MAS focused on strengthening the core of our
            business, by building a diversified and resilient customer
            portfolio, improving efficiencies in manufacturing, and securing an
            optimized supply chain. With the addition of new customers from new
            geographies to our portfolio, the strategic engagement through the
            joint venture with Tata Group’s Trent Ltd, and the launch of TEXO
            through the acquisition of BAM Knitting in Sri Lanka, we have
            provided our business with key building blocks for the future, while
            augmenting a vertically integrated manufacturing footprint in Sri
            Lanka.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2022, we also witnessed the growth of our femtech vertical,
            recently rebranded as femography, and strengthened through new
            customer partnerships. Our Adaptive Centre of Excellence, Lable by
            MAS, was formally launched in 2022, building on years of work in
            this space to further develop our capability in offering adaptive
            apparel solutions for persons with disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a key focus on creating sustainable alternatives for the
            products and apparel solutions that we offer our customers, our
            strategic business unit Noyon Lanka introduced ‘Planetones,’ a 100%
            natural dye solution certified by the Control Union, through which
            we continue to explore the opportunity of creating garments coloured
            exclusively with natural dyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our biggest strength remains the collective capability of MAS,
            innovating new technologies that are applicable across multiple
            product categories, enabling us to offer integrated innovation,
            design, development, manufacturing and supply chain solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            A testament to these efforts is the recent recognition of our
            innovation arm, Twinery, by Fast Company in its list for ‘Best
            Workplaces for Innovators’. This recognition honours organisations
            committed to innovation at all levels, and it was a privilege to see
            MAS being ranked among other global giants such as Microsoft and
            Siemens.
          </p>
          <p>
            And as always, our commitment to sustainability remains clear and
            robust despite external challenges, with our work being recognised
            at the highest levels across the globe. MAS was selected as a
            finalist at the Reuters’ Responsible Business Awards 2022 in the
            Diversity, Equity and Inclusion category, and our Ocean Strainer
            initiative was named as a finalist in the Water Category of Fast
            Company’s 2022 ‘World Changing Ideas’.

            With a specialist team set up within the business to explore the
            partnerships, knowledge, technology, and investments that are
            required to make this ambition a reality, we remain confident that
            MAS will be able to unlock this challenge and establish a path to a
            fully circular business model.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the global economic downturn impacting key markets such as the
            US and the EU and resulting in lower volumes, 2023 and 2024 will
            prove to be challenging years for the apparel industry, with a
            particular impact on apparel manufacturers.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we navigate these challenges as a global business, MAS remains
            committed to improving our sustainable business model, and
            delivering upon the commitments made in the MAS Plan for Change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through our own work and through collaborations with likeminded
            partners, we will strive to build a truly sustainable business,
            creating changemakers and committing to transform our world for
            good.
